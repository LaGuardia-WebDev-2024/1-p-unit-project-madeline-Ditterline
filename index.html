<h1>What is Twin Peaks?</h1>
        <p>Twin Peaks is a TV show that was crated by David 
            Lynch and Mark Frost. 
            The show started airing in 1990 and finished out 
            its second season in 1991. <br>
            In 2017, the showrunners aired a third season
             with many of the same characters as a sequel 
             to 
        the original run of the series. <br>
     Though the show started out as a surrealist satire of
    the soap operas of the time,
     the emotional arcs, comedy, drama and horror made
      the show truly iconic. <br>Many things that weren't very
    common in TV shows at the time have become a staple 
    of our modern TV culture. Lynch and Frost mastered tonal 
    whiplash within this series, <br>being able to 
    go from a light-hearted comedic 
scene to discussing a horrific murder in just a matter of 
moments.
    </p>
<h2>The cast of Twin Peaks</h2>
<em>Twin Peaks contains many different storylines and 
many different characters. I will only be 
including major characters from season 1 & early season 2, 
and no one from the return, which I haven't seen. </em>

   <ul>
        <li><strong>Laura Palmer</strong>: Laura Palmer was a
             widely beloved
        seventeen year old with a tragic life and many dark

         show in motion.</li>

        ambitious

infatuation with the FBI agent staying at her 
father's hotel...</li>

the extent of what's going <br> on around him, but tries to be as 
helpful as he can be.</li>
<li><Strong>Josie Packard</Strong>: Inherited The Mill after her 
    husband's death. Carried many dark secrets with her when she
arrived from Hong Kong, <br> and they all are starting to catch up
with her.</li>
</ul>
<h3><li><strong><em>Meet the Johnsons</em></strong></li></h3>

Bobby, <br> her boyfriend, hatch a plan to free both of them from Leo's 
grasp.</li>
<li><strong>Bobby Briggs</strong>: Laura's boyfriend who was 
cheating on her with Shelley. Laura convinced him to start selling
coke--and now he's in a lot of debt with<br> Leo, who is <em>not</em> a good

<ul>
<li><strong>Norma Jennings</strong>: Owner of 
    The Double R Diner and

for years now, despite the 
both of them being married.</li>
<li><strong>Hank Jennings</strong>: Norma's 
    husband, convicted of
vehicular manslaughter and up for parole. 
However, manslaughter isn't 
even close to <br> the only crime he's committed...</li>
<li><strong>Ed Hurley</strong>: Aka 'Big Ed", 
    the owner of Big Ed's 
Gas Farm, a gas station. Takes care of his 
nephew, James and works with

regrets his decision to marry Nadine.</li>
<li><strong>Nadine Hurley</strong>: A mentally
     unstable woman who has
found her purpose in inventing silent drape 
runners. She loves Ed very
much. Her<br> behavior is erratic and strange.</li>
</ul>
<h3><li><strong><em>Key Witnesses</em></strong></li></h3>
