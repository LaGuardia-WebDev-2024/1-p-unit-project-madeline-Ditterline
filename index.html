<h1>What is Twin Peaks?</h1>
        <p>Twin Peaks is a TV show that was crated by David 
            Lynch and Mark Frost. 
            The show started airing in 1990 and finished out 
            its second season in 1991. 
            In 2017, the showrunners aired a third season
             with many of the same characters as a sequel 
             to 
        the original run of the series. <br>
     Though the show started out as a surrealist satire of
    the soap operas of the time,
     the emotional arcs, comedy, drama and horror made
      the show truly iconic. Many things that weren't very
    common in TV shows at the time have become a staple 
    of our modern TV culture. Lynch and Frost mastered tonal 
    whiplash within this series, being able to 
    go from a light-hearted comedic 
scene to discussing a horrific murder in just a matter of 
moments. </table>
